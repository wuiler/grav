Today its **Friday's of Wallpaper!!!**  
We are going to relax from code and bring some love to our desktop with some Java Wallpapers.   
I made a special site on Github for that an you can contribute to it on : https://github.com/wuiler/java-art
Even though I said you were going to relax us from the code the second wallpaper I design is base on code: https://github.com/wuiler/javafx-images
